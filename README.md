# 💧 Water Potability Prediction  

This project predicts whether water is **safe to drink** based on its quality parameters.  
I built this while preparing for college applications, and even though I was new to ML, I pushed myself because I wanted to explore how **AI can help solve real environmental and public-health problems**.  

It wasn’t easy — handling missing values, understanding metrics, and tuning models were challenging. But this project represents my dedication and curiosity to learn AI through real-world problems instead of just theory.
